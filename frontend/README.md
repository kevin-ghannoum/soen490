## Project Setup
Prerequisites:

Once the packages have been install, there are a couple of commands to get you started:

`npm start`
> Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
> > 

`npm test`
> Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
Configured to use the framework Enzyme for UI testing.
> > 

`npm run build`
